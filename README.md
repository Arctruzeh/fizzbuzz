# FizzBuzz Benchmark

A high-fidelity "Industrial Assemblage" themed benchmark for FizzBuzz implementations. This project goes beyond the basic interview question to explore performance characteristics of different PHP strategies.

## Features

*   **Industrial Assemblage Design**: A custom aesthetic featuring "Deep Oil Black" backgrounds, CRT-style code displays, mechanical switch interactions, and stamped steel typography.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: Runs 1000 iterations of each strategy to calculate Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Variance execution times.
*   **Dynamic Sorting**: Sort results by Average, Min, Max, Variance, or Overall Score.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Active metrics are highlighted in "Phosphor Green" for quick analysis.
*   **Multiple Strategies**: Includes Classic Modulo, Recursive, Pattern-Based, String Concatenation, and modern PHP 8+ Match expressions.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: PHP (Logic & API)
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (Benchmarking Logic), Vanilla CSS (Custom Design System)
*   **Design**: Custom "Industrial" theme using CSS gradients, box-shadows, and Google Fonts (VT323, Share Tech Mono).
